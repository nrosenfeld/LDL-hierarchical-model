Done as the final project for STATS 551, this project uses a Bayesian approach and MCMC techniques
to propose a hierarchical model for the distribution of LDL cholesterol among different sexes and
races/ethnicities. 
This group project was done by myself (Nathan Rosenfeld) together with Shalin Adhvaryu and Zizhe Wang.
